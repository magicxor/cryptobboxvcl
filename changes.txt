* [All] (SFTP) Added /usr/libexec/sftp-server to the list of known sftp server executable locations (SFTP-over-command-channel mode)

- [All] (FTPS, SFTP) UploadFiles didn't ignore subfolders and attempted to upload them as files, which attempt produced an error code in the end of method. Fixed.

  However, this behaviour is standard-compliant and failures can happen only with malformed responses and CA certificates, which were reissued with different Subject RDN.
  If you need to return old behaviour, the easiest way is to set SBRDN.__Global.IgnoreTagsWhenComparingRDNs = true; (in .NET) or SBRDN.IgnoreTagsWhenComparingRDNs = true; (Java)
